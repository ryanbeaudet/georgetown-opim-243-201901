# The "Sales Reporting" Exercise

## Business Prompt

Assume you own and operate a successful small business, selling artisan clothing products through an online platform like Amazon, Etsy, or eBay.

At the end of each calendar month, the online platform makes available for download from its admin interface a CSV file representing all individual sales orders for that month. See the ["monthly sales data"](/data/monthly-sales) examples (row per day per product sold that day).

To aid your ability to make data-driven decisions, you decide to create a Python program which will automate the process of gleaning business insights from the monthly sales data.

## Objectives

Practice using Python to process CSV files in such a way as to automate a business process.

## Prerequisites

  + [The `os` Module]((/notes/python/modules/os.md))
  + [The `csv` Module](/notes/python/modules/csv.md) or [The `pandas` Package](/notes/python/packages/pandas.md)
  + [The `itertools` Module](/notes/python/modules/itertools.md) (maybe helpful for "Further Exploration" challenge)

## Setup

Create a new exercise repository called "sales-reporting" somewhere on your computer, perhaps on your Desktop.

Download any one of the ["monthly sales data"](/data/monthly-sales) CSV files into your exercise repository, either in the root directory or inside a new sub-directory called "data".

Create a new Python script called something like "sales_reporter.py" and place inside some temporary Python code like `print("SALES REPORT (MONTH YEAR)")` inside. Then save the file and make your first commit with a message like "Setup exercise repo".

## Instructions

Adapt the contents of the "sales_reporter.py" script to process the CSV file to display a human-readable representation of the given month and year and the total sales for that month.

Example output:

```
SALES REPORT (MARCH 2018)

TOTAL SALES: $12,000.71
```

## Further Exploration

Optionally adapt your script to also identify the three top-selling products for that month and the total sales for each.

Example output:

```
SALES REPORT (MARCH 2018)

TOTAL SALES: $12,000.71

TOP SELLING PRODUCTS:
  1. Button-Down Shirt: $6,960.35
  2. Super Soft Hoodie: $1,875.00
  3. etc.
```
