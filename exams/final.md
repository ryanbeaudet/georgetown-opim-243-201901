# Final Exam

## Description

The final exam is designed to evaluate students' knowledge of programming concepts and software development practices.

The exam will be administered during the final class period. The exam will be administered in paper format, so students should remember to bring a pen or pencil.

The exam consists primarily of free-response questions, but may also contain multiple-choice and matching questions.

Details about the contents of the final exam will be announced during a final exam preparation session.

Students may consult these exams from previous semesters in an effort to understand the kinds of questions that might be asked:
